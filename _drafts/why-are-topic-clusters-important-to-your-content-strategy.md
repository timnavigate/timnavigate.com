title: Why are topic clusters important to your content strategy?
---

When it comes to improving your search rankings for broad keywords, topic clusters are an excellent long-term strategy.
Even if a websiteâ€™s content is excellent, most websites start with a low Domain Authority and can't rank for highly competitive keyword terms.
This is where topic clusters can help in enhancing your content marketing campaign, allowing you to gain greater authority with your audience.

### How does this happen?

Well, it's nearly impossible to rank for a single keyword these days, therefore clusters allow you to target entire topics and thus raise the number of interlinked pages.

Topic clusters can help your site rank for less competitive keywords and drive traffic right away. It is possible to compete for competitive keywords when more people recognize your site's authority, and your domain authority grows as a result.

Topic clusters also make it easy for visitors to move around your website and locate the subject matter they're interested in.

In terms of Google's bots, they have a faster time finding all the articles and figuring out how to rank them properly. If you're targeting a competitive short-tail keyword, your pillar content will rank higher, while your sub-content will rank higher for long-tail keywords.

For example, Moz's [Guide to Content Marketing](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-content-marketing) is a great example of topic clusters: a pillar content page links to narrowly defined subtopics, and each sub-content piece links to a pillar page and interlinks with one another.

The three main SEO objectives of topic clusters are as follows:

*   Increase your search traffic for long-tail keywords with lower search volume.
    
*   Perform better for more competitive terms.
    
*   Establish yourself as an authority in that field.
