title: Why are topic clusters important to search engine optimization (SEO)?
---

Google needs to know if your web pages are both relevant and authoritative in comparison to your competitors. Thatâ€™s why topic clusters are so important for driving organic traffic to your website.

It's no longer enough to just include keywords in a web page's content when assessing its position in Google. It searches for synonyms, subtopics, and even answers to frequently asked questions about your industry when a user is looking for information about it.

Consequently, many SEO professionals' content strategies now include topic clusters as an important component.

In SEO, a topic cluster is a group of related topics, such as:

*   Pillar content with a high volume of search intent for the phrase;
    
*   A slew of closely linked articles, each having a narrower focus and lower competition;
    
*   Internal and external linking within and between the pillar's content and other relevant pages.
    

Topic clusters show Google that your website has industry expertise and offers a breadth of helpful, in-depth material about significant themes in your industry, and it also helps Google comprehend the hierarchy of your website and how your content interrelates.

The truth is that most companies specialize in more than one area. It's a good idea to start thinking about topic clustering while building your website instead of merely using keywords.
