title: Implement a Topic Cluster Strategy
---

Letâ€™s have a look at how to create a topic cluster strategy.

### Choose the topic you want to rank

The first step is to choose the topic you wish to rank for on search engines. You should be able to cover all of the different components of one pillar page with this specificity. At the same time, it's wide enough to support many articles on the topic.

For example, "Content marketing" is an excellent topic, but there is too much to cover in a single blog post.

Content marketing, on the other hand, is so wide that you may write a variety of articles on it, such as "setting your content marketing budget" and "things to consider when selecting themes for your content marketing strategy." At the same time, you may write a complete article about content marketing that addresses all of the various issues.

### Determine your content clusters

Your content clusters are the next step once you've narrowed down your topic. 5 to 10 is a reasonable range.

### How do you create a topic cluster strategy?

When it comes to SEO, topic modeling is a key component, and we'll go into more detail about how to create and implement a content cluster strategy in this section.

#### Create cluster content before the pillar

First, you need to figure out how much existing material you have and how much content you need.

A [content audit](/blog/how-to-do-a-content-audit) examines a website's content to see if it's making a positive impact on the overall performance of the site. This content includes your metadata, such as title headers and meta descriptions, as well as your articles and pages.

Here's how to conduct an audit in the context of pillar pages and topic clusters:

*   Create a list of all the topics you've covered.
    
*   Identify links that compete with one other in the SERPs (SERP).
    
*   Look for areas of duplication and voids in your topic's content.
    

Use a shared Excel or Google spreadsheet to keep track of current content and potential links within a topic cluster.

Every piece of content on your website should strive to achieve a couple of the following goals:

*   Increase the number of visitors to your website;
    
*   Help you in achieving a higher ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs);
    
*   Increase the time spent on your website and the number of pages visited by supporting current content (through internal linking);
    
*   Help in the conversion and selling of products;
    
*   Encourage visitors to return;
    
*   Increase your brand authority.
    

Identifying and eliminating content that is no longer useful to your website may be a good SEO move, especially if low-quality content is competing for the same keywords on a SERP with higher-quality content.

Consider the structure and start with the core topic. You'll know exactly how to refer to the most thorough cluster pages across your clusters if you start with them. Conversely, if you design higher-level pages before learning the fundamentals, such pages and sections may feel like placeholders that don't deliver actual value to consumers.

Before developing a pillar page, create cluster content to verify that you aren't replicating previous material on your site and allow for internal linking across the many topics.

#### Create Buyer Personas

People are the driving force behind search engine optimization. The first step to a successful SEO strategy is to analyze user behavior. Keyword research is just figuring out what people are looking for. Every time Google updates its algorithm, it does so in response to new patterns in user behavior.

To put it another way, there is no difference between the two. Consider who will be reading your website's material to get an idea of what themes should be the focus of your approach. And buyer personas are the best approach to getting to your customers.

Your industry may need the creation of many customer profiles. The buyer personas you've created should be examined in further detail. Ask yourself: What are the difficulties they are having? What are they struggling with? Identify five to ten key issues that a customer expects your company to resolve.

To lead your target audience from awareness to conversion, you must first identify your audience's demographics. When you sketch out the customer's journey, you can remove roadblocks and stay at the top of their mind along the way. To ensure you don't miss out on huge possibilities, cluster pages may be used to fill in the gaps in the process.

### Internal linking and tracking of anchor text used

To fit the jigsaw together, you'll need to use links to connect your clusters and pillar pages. Every piece of cluster content should connect to the pillar page and the pillar page should be organically interspersed with links to cluster content.

Internal links are what give topic clusters their staying strength. In other words, the more strategic you are, the more traffic and conversions your clusters will bring to your site.

Search engine optimization relies heavily on internal links. However, when it comes to topic clusters, they play a dual role. The first benefit is that more information about your content is available to search engines. Second, all of the URLs in a cluster share [PageRank](/blog/what-is-pagerank) between themselves via internal links. In this case, the value of the backlinks will be passed on more effectively to the other pages in your cluster if a few of them receive a lot of attention.

Adding internal links inside a subject cluster is all about placing them where they'll be most useful. If a term appears several times on a page, yet a separate part is devoted just to that subtopic, the link should go there.

To help you with your content audit, we've compiled a list of recommended resources.

**Google Analytics**

Using Google Analytics, you can track stats for each page on your site to see whether it needs to be repurposed, updated, or taken down.

**Screaming Frog**

Site audit tool Screaming Frog may help you uncover duplicate content, slow-loading web pages, broken links, and URLs that Google has banned. Page titles and metadata are analyzed for optimization, and statistics on visits, impressions, and conversions are collected.

Using Screaming Frog is the best way to get all the data you need. As a result, you'll have a simpler time analyzing the material and determining your next course of action.

**Google Search Console**

Using Google's Search Console, you can see how your website ranks in search results. Using Search Console, you can learn about your content's average position, the CTR (click-through rate) for each piece, and how many hits or impressions each page receives in search.

### Review your existing content

Ensure that your present content is up to date, and then connect it to your pillar page. This allows you to make the most of the content you already have and fill in any gaps you may discover.

One area of your issue may have been well-researched, but a longer keyword phrase may have gone unnoticed by you. Notice these gaps. After some time has passed, you may use them to create new cluster content for your pillar page.

In addition to increasing your website's search engine visibility, a content cluster approach helps you generate new content ideas. You can readily discover any gaps in your content by using a topic-based content cluster approach.

Take a moment to reflect on the cluster's ultimate aim. You're attempting to collect a comprehensive library of material on a single subject. You may think that the more clusters you have, the less you have to write about them, but we've found that this isn't the case. In the course of writing about a subject, new questions and ideas are bound to arise.

Moreover, this is just for a single cluster. The more clusters you have, the more chances you have of finding content gaps inside those clusters.
