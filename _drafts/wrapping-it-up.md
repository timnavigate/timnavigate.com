There is no question that using a content cluster approach is beneficial for those who regularly post new blogs or currently maintain a significant content archive since it allows you to improve both current and future content.

Long-form, high-quality pillar content attracts users at the beginning of the sales funnel. In the middle and bottom of the funnel, content pages clustered around related keywords target even more narrow themes than that. Your content and inbound marketing strategy becomes more structured and efficient when you implement a topic cluster model.

In addition, search engines are becoming better at identifying the semantic links between subtopics and primary topics. Your search engine optimization efforts will also benefit from the investment in topic clusters.
