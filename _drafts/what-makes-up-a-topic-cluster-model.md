title: What makes up a topic cluster model?
---

Companies use the topic cluster model to streamline their content marketing strategy. Instead of focusing on keywords, Google’s SEO strategy emphasizes ranking for topics.

An intent-based approach rather than a keyword-based approach is a topic cluster model. Blog archives are simplified by focusing on one key topic, known as the "pillar" page or article.

Here are a few terms that you should be familiar with when it comes to the topic cluster model.

### Pillar page

One of the most important parts of every website is a "pillar" page, which serves as the central hub for all of the site's content. The strength of pillar pages is derived from the cluster pages, much like the spokes on a bicycle wheel.

It is common practice to use pillar pages as the primary landing page for a content hub. Readers will be introduced or redirected to relevant topics as a result of your most important content themes. When used in a topic cluster strategy, they become echo chambers of context, relevance, and authority for search engines.

For pillar posts, the content is typically longer than the rest of the articles on a blog. Generally speaking, they are at least 2,000 words long. However, keep in mind that they are not only lengthy pieces of content but also quite thorough in their subject matter.

### Cluster content

Using content clusters is a great approach to connect your content and search engine optimization strategy.

Creating a "cluster" of content based on a single topic is known as a "content cluster."

It's important to understand that the "Who, What, Where, When, and Why" of a particular transactional page (or pillar page) on your site are all addressed within the framework of a single "content cluster." In order to increase the authority of the transactional or pillar page, each of these blog entries delves deeply into the subject matter.

In the end, the goal is to model the entire cluster of material to be as relevant to your topic as feasible.

### Internal links

Internal links are hyperlinks that point to (target) the same domain as the link's host domain (source). An internal link is a link that connects to another page on the same website.

There are three benefits to using these kinds of links:

*   A website can't function without them because it serves as the site’s navigation.
    
*   They help in the creation of a website's hierarchy of information and keep track of links to different pieces of content.
    
*   They help in the distribution of link equity (ranking power).
    

The content of a page is what search engines look for while compiling enormous keyword indices. You can't find all of the pages on your website without having a crawlable link structure, which allows spiders to explore the routes of your site.

### Example of Topic Cluster

NerdWallet is a personal finance startup that aims to empower people to make better financial decisions by providing them with financial education. For example, whether a customer is seeking the best credit card or comparing their debt consolidation loan alternatives, NerdWallet's content provides information and tools that will help them in learning about and evaluating financial goods and services. Their content marketing approach is based on the company's aim to give customers fair, clear, and reliable information so that they may make informed financial decisions with confidence.

Their team has developed a series of content pillars in the form of "guides" to help you in managing your money in all facets of your life, ranging from insurance to vacation planning. Each guide serves as a central hub for hundreds of other articles that delve deeper into specific themes linked to the hub.

Credit cards are covered in the first section, which includes connections to some of their most popular and useful pages on the subject.

Following that, they actually begin providing you with their credit card evaluations right on the pillar piece, so you don't even have to click any further into their website.

A section dedicated to some of their greatest and most educational guides on credit cards is also included on their website.

There's little question that taking this method helps search engines better understand what the page and related sites are about. It also provides a better user experience for your reader.

And it's an excellent example of pillar content that isn't necessarily a blog post or a guide - but rather a "hub" of information. This strategy is being used by an increasing number of sites.

This comprehensive technique has allowed NerdWallet to rank towards the top of search results for every topic, and it has resulted in "[16 million unique users per month last year](https://debanked.com/2021/10/nerdwallet-names-its-competition-reveals-its-web-traffic-figures/)," according to the company.
