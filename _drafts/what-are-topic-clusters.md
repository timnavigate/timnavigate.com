title: What are topic clusters?
---

A topic cluster is a group of interlinked web pages centered on a big piece of content known as pillar content.

[HubSpot Research](https://research.hubspot.com/topic-clusters-seo?__hstc=41899389.faeffaf24c02c686b4d41d6646627d73.1705192814578.1705192814578.1705192814578.1&__hssc=41899389.1.1705192814579&__hsfp=3969885215) revealed the topic cluster methodology, often known as the pillar-and-cluster technique, in 2017.

To keep people on your site, the pillar content covers a broad topic and provides various [internal linking](/blog/internal-links) opportunities to other pages within the pillar content that targets a particular subject.

There are numerous advantages to using the topic cluster paradigm, such as the following:

*   **Streamlined content delivery.** Pillar pages allow you to organize your material in a way that makes sense to you and your reader. Using pillar pages, you may organize your blog around a series of related posts.
    
*   I**mproved search engine optimization (SEO).** In the long run, this strategy will help your blog's SEO by establishing your expertise in a specific topic.
    
*   **Accelerated content creation.** With all of your research already in place, topic cluster pages are a breeze to put together because they all share the same pillar page.
    
*   **More in-depth content.** Make sure your content doesn't have any gaps or overlaps. For example, if your pillar page discusses search engine optimization, the cluster pages could discuss main topics such as choosing the right keywords or the basics of writing SEO pages. So, your original blog will not go into too much detail about these subjects.
