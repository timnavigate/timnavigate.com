Drafts are posts without a date in the filename. They’re posts you’re still working on and don’t want to publish yet. To get up and running with drafts, create a `_drafts` folder in your site’s root and create your first draft:

```
. 
├── _drafts 
│   └── a-draft-post.md 
...
```

To preview your site with drafts, run `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build` with the `--drafts` switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
