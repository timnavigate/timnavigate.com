title: How To Create Keyword & Topic Clusters
---

Topic clusters are about providing a variety of content that revolves around a single term. To do this, you'll need one main keyword for the pillar article and a number of related terms as backlink content.
The difficulty of a keyword and its search volume play a role in topic clustering content strategy. It is important to brainstorm and arrange subtopics by low-search-volume keywords, including questions and long-tail ones, while the main keyword is a broad one with high search traffic.
Creating topic clusters on your website will help it rank higher in search results and be easier for your visitors to navigate. 

Keyword clustering has the following advantages:

*   Build expertise and authority in your industry area.
    
*   Improved search engine result page rankings.
    
*   Increased organic traffic.
    
*   Additional internal linking opportunities.
    

Keyword clustering and developing a content strategy around it are explained in the next paragraphs.

### Step 1: Make a List of Your Keywords.

Researching keywords is the first step in keyword clustering.Â  Make a list of the most important and specific keywords for which you hope your website will be discovered.

Identify all of the variations, long-tail phrases, and subtopics that people are searching for using that term.

A keyword tool may be used to find out what other people are searching for when looking for products and services like yours. To get started, look at what your competitors are currently ranking for in the search engines.

Use these data to determine which keywords are most valuable and should be used as the "core" keywords in your keyword clusters.

When you first start, a hundred keyword phrases are likely to indicate many different topic clusters that you may then develop further on your website.

When deciding which topics or subtopics to tackle, think about how important they are to your business and marketing objectives, then order them by search volume and possible traffic.

You only want to add keywords that will bring visitors who are truly interested in what you have to offer and are likely to convert to paying customers to your site.

You might also look for cluster ideas using SEMrush or Ahrefs' Keyword Explorer. Both generate a list of similar terms with their respective search volumes.

### Step 2: Create Groups for Your Keywords

In time, you will begin to see trends in your keyword list as you accumulate more and more terms.

There are likely to be recurring terms and phrases that appear in searcher's requests. Clustering and grouping keywords can be accomplished in a variety of ways, as seen by these patterns.

In order to organize your list of keywords into groups, consider the following criteria.

#### Semantic Relevance

Semantic keywords are closely related to the original keyword, and as a result, they provide search engine spiders with more information about the topic and depth of the content. This data helps the algorithm that determines where a page ranks in the search results.

Search engines will be confused if you try to rank a page for a variety of unrelated keywords at the same time.

#### CPC and Search Volume

Your clusters' primary keywords should have a reasonable volume of searches, or you may end up optimizing for nobody.

Conversion potential is also a must which is why CPCs are important because they speak to their economic value.

#### Organic Difficulty

The authority of your site and the strength of your backlinks will play a role in determining whether or not you should target more difficult organic keywords.

Include in your clusters just those keywords for which your site has a reasonable chance of ranking.

These metrics will determine how efficient your keyword research is.
